Multi-modal Photo Upsampling via Latent Space & Exploration of StyleGAN

PULSE (Photo Upsampling via Latent Space Exploration) produces high-resolution images with high accuracy; however, it outputs only one image. MM-PULSE aims to address and solve the limitations of PULSE by integrating StyleGAN2 into the PULSE architecture, enhancing the quality of generated images and using different random latents achieving multi-modality. Additionally, it employs an InterFaceGAN-based approach to determine semantic directions for attributes like ’smile’, ’bangs’ and ’hair color’ and utilizes them to perform targeted edits on the generated images.
